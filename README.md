# Quiz/Survey Generator

## Overview
The Quiz/Survey Generator is a web-based application designed to allow users to create, manage, and take quizzes or surveys with ease. This project was developed to enhance my skills in TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS while also implementing key software engineering concepts such as state management, local storage, and asynchronous operations.

The application allows users to:
- Create quizzes and surveys with customizable questions (multiple-choice, true/false, and short answer formats).
- Edit, delete, and rearrange questions before publishing the quiz.
- Take quizzes and surveys, submit answers, and view results.
- Validate input fields to ensure proper data entry.
- Persist quizzes and responses using local storage.

This project demonstrates TypeScript's strong typing, React's component-based architecture, and TailwindCSS's utility-first styling approach.
